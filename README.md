# My first AWS Lambda project

My personal learning project using AWS Lambdas, Node.js and Serverless

This is a personal learning project, so don't look for best practices or idiomatic code! ;)


Inspired by https://serverless.com/blog/node-rest-api-with-serverless-lambda-and-dynamodb/

## Prerequisites

Node:
```
brew install node
```

NPM:
```
npm install -g serverless
npm install -g mocha
```

## Authentication

Set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env variables.

Load the keypair `.pem` file into ssh agent.
